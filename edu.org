* ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces)
** Knowledge Structure
- Topic Concepts (aka Problem Types)
  - Example of Topic is pre-algebra and example of problem type is percentage
- Precedence Diagrams
  - Problem types need to be learnt in a certain order as learning of one might
    be dependent on knowing of another. Precedence diagram is a DAG with nodes
    as problem types and edges defining precedence.
- Knowledge State
  - a subset of all problem types which may be reached by following a certain path in
    the precedence diagram
- Outer Fringe of a knowledge State: the next set of problem types which can be
  learnt given a knowledge state, i.e. the set of problem type nodes reachable
  from a given state using the precedence diagram
- Inner Fringe is the last set of problem types learnt for a given knowledge
  state, i.e. the frontier of a knowledge state in the precedence diagram
- Knowledge state of a student can be succinctly summarized using the inner
  fringe and outer fringe
- [[~/research/PieKul/Notes/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf][Knowledge Space Theory]]
** Creation of Knowledge Structure 
- By Questioning Experts/Teachers on different sub-topics
- Cleaned and Maintained using data collected from students over time
** Computing State of a Student
- Based on asking a certain set of questions, once can determine the outer
  fringe and inner fringe of knowledge state of a student.

* McGraw Hill 
** LearnSmart/SmartBook
- At a high level it is a flashcard system integrated into a book to allow
  efficient learning and retention
- Read : different section of the contents are highlighted as green, yellow, black or gray.
  - Green: content mastered
  - yellow: important content, need to be mastered (dynamically updated based
    on practice questions)
  - Black: should read but not as important as yellow content
  - Gray: could be skipped
- Practice: Flashcard like Q&A
  - Cloze form or multi-choice questions
  - allows student feedback using following clickable buttons
    - know for sure
    - think I know
    - Not sure
    - Don't know
  - Tied/Points to relevant content in the textbook
- Review
  - Flashcard based review before exam
- Evaluation:
  - Allows analysis of student's strength/weakness in terms of topics
    - One can identify the following 4 categories:
      - Knows topic and is aware of it - this should be the most as a percentage of topics
      - Knows topic but is not aware of it
      - Doesn't know topic and is aware that (s)he doesn't know
      - Doesn't know topic but thinks (s)he know it - this should be the least as a percentage

** Connect
- Allows collaboration between student and teacher
  - Allows student to ask Qs
  - Allows teacher to assess weak and strong areas of a student

* McMillan
- *Flipit*
  - Platform for Course content (video) selection & scheduling
  - Pre-lecture content includes:
    - Videos
    - Bridge Qs
  - Based on Feedback, instructor can change the content of her lectures
  - Also a platform for Post-lecture Problem
- *LaunchPad/LearningCurve*
  - Interactive e-book (additional to textbook)
  - Learning curve - Q&A based assessment system to tailor learning based on
    Student's understanding level (very much like smartbook assessment)
    - but not like Aleks
  - Integrates grades and assignment calendar etc
    - gradebook gives fine-grained assessment on assignments and classwork
  - optional pre-built units (by author of book) - ready made assignments
  - Video assignment tool facilitates assignment and assessment of video based
    activities

* Cengage
- *MindTap:* Mobile app which integrates:
  - ebook
  - flashcards
  - Quizzes
  - Calendar
- *Aplia:*
  - Course Assignment & Question Creation and assessment System
    - Create Assignment
      - Create Qs in various formats (cloze, multiple-choice, essay)
      - Can copy/paste pre-created assignments from an assignment library
      - link to reading assignment
    - Integrates a Grade Mgmt system
- *Owlv2 (Online Web‐based Learning)*
  - Chemistry Specific
  - Seems like mostly a assignment creation for teachers and assignment
    taking for students and grading system
  - All the other stuff is an afterthought bolt on
  - Provides you with the tools necessary for studying class materials, taking
    assignments, analyzing your progress, and tracking your grades from
    wherever you have Internet access.
  - While working at your own pace, or within a schedule set‐up by your
    instructor, you can work on step‐by‐step tutorials, interactive
    simulations, homework questions, read an interactive eBook, take exams, and
    track your overall course progress. OWLv2 gives you an easy‐to‐use,
    personalized online environment that you can manage to best suit your
    needs.

* IClicker

- Allows Teacher to quiz/poll student in real-time in class
  - Once a Q is asked, students are forced to think and participate (as the Qs
    count towards their grade)
  - Fosters active learning as you are forcing students to participate
- Gives you instant feedback as to what you are teaching is being absorbed by
  students
- You can compile the list of Qs you asked in class as study guide
- Allows students to ask Qs
- The above points foster active learning

* How to improve existing Education technology
- Concept Graph Creation
  - Crawl wikipedia and other rich sources to discover concepts, their
    importance and precedence (in terms of which concpet should be learnt
    before another)

    - Assist for building a precedence graph (as in knowledge space theory)

    - Apply concepts from PGM to add/delete/edit edges in this graph

    - A precedence graph will be useful in generating learning path(s)

    - Edges in the graph might be weighted based on difficulty in learning a
      new concept from a given node. The weights can be adjusted based on student feedback 
      (i.e. data) using PGM concepts

    - Path weights can also be used in determining what is the best path in
      reaching a concept node (i.e. guiding a student thru a set of
      intermediate concepts to reach his final goal of learning a concept)
   
  - Facilitates Unbundling of books
    - content traversal geared towards problem solving
      - allow a user to discover path(s) between a pair of knowledge nodes he
        may have specified

    - content traversal geared towards teaching a class

    - Allows discovering, ranking and recommending rich content to users

      - specially in the neighborhood of a persons knowledge state

      - Based on ranking of content we can recommend top 5 content sources on
        the side

      - content can be rich and live, e.g. youtube videos, images, voice etc

  - Facilitates auto Q&A Generation

    - Each concept in the graph becomes an answer and the surrounding context(s)
      can be used to generate question(s)

    - Ideas in MT can be used for paraphrasing Qs

  - Also allows auto-generating Definitional Question

    - Ideas from sentence/passage similarity (which takes semantics into
      account) can be used to rank a free form text answer

- Generate simple formulaic Qs using Templates

  - For each problem type we can generate 1 or few (say 5) templates

  - Quantities and variables can be changed randomly

  - Ideas in MT can be used for paraphrasing Qs
