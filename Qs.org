- How is your model relevant for Enterprise use cases with little data and many
  domain specific and low frequency keywords?

  - Canned set of Q&A

  - Question Paraphrasing

  - Rule based pattern matching (NE/Relationship recognition)

  - Transfer Learning & retraining

  - Domain specific keywords 

- How many unlabelled data rows does the information source corpus need?

- How many Question and Answer pairs (labelled data) does your model need?

  - It depends the context or knowledge source and the type of question

    - Getting answers for factual questions from a hand curated KB or from a
      corpus of documents may require no data as we could use transfer learning

- How do you measure accuracy of your answers?

  - Accuracy @ Rank 1

  - MRR

  - MAP

- What is the accuracy of your answers?

  - Again depends on question type & knowledge souce

    - Answering questions by simply parsing a corpus of documents might be
      60-80%

    - Answering paraphrase of canned questions might be 95%

    - Answering factual questions from hand curated KBs might be 80-90%

- How do you handle ill formed questions? Do you follow up with clarifying
  questions to understand the question or provide a generic response?

  - Yes, if a relation/entity is not in the KB, we can ask a clarifying question

- Do you chain the thread of questions to improve answers progressively?

  - Yes.

- How much do you crawl outside the corpus to cover aspects of Qs that have
  some knowledge outside the scope of corpus?

  - We can use knowledge from Freebase, Wikipedia etc

- What modes among text, audio, image, and video you support for corpus?

  - All

- What modes are supported for asking Questions? Delivering Answers?

  - 

- What are the file formats and languages you ingest? For example
  ASCII/UTF-8/16 for text, english for language, jpg for images, ...?

- What safeguards do you have to not answer unauthorized users?

- How do you protect data and ensure you're compliant to safeguards

- How long does it take for you train the model?

- What is your reaction/prediction time once a question is asked?

- How many active user sessions can your system support? How long do you keep
  the session history?

- What is the maximum data your system can ingest?


- Value:
  over IR, to enterprise etc
- Amount of Data Required
- Results
- Conversation Aspects
  - feedback on ill-formed questions, chaining of questions/context
- Modes Supported
- User experience
  - reaction time of the model
