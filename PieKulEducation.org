Q: What is the vision of future on which PieKul is built?

A: Imagine an eLearning platform where students discover concepts 
and navigate the inter-relationship of concepts by simply asking 
questions. The system responds with follow on clarifying questions,
if need be, or with an answer in the form of a highly cross linked 
simulation aided rich multimedia/live content.

PieKul is building the fundamental pieces required to deliver a 
"Questions & Answers" (QnA) framework for an eLearning platform.

Q: What need does PieKul fulfill?

A: eLearning platforms are required to meet the diverse needs of 
the following stakeholders:
a) Students need content presentation to be multi-dimensionally 
informative, engaging, accessible, collaboration friendly, and 
exhaustive. 
b) Educators need tools to design new learning opportunities and 
set personalized goals for students. They need technologies that 
can process data and analyse/evaluate the engagement, feedback, 
progress, areas of need of students. 
c) Publishers need tools to convert legacy content or publish 
new digital content imbibed with the values needed for 21st 
century learning as well as data-processing/analytics engines 
to evaluate the engagement/feedback data of Students/Educators. 
d) Parents need a system using which they can easily an even 
proactively use to track the performance, progress, and engagement 
of their student on the learning material as well as to 
communicate/collaborate with the Educator/student to support 
learning goals.

Innovative companies are creating systems to imbibe game values 
to make the content multi-dimensionally informative and engaging 
through immersive experience. However, work remains to make the 
content easily accessible, collaborative, and exhaustive.

Q: What is PieKul's product/service?

A: We are building a SaaS hosted content data processing, learning, 
and analytics QnA pipeline to power an eLearning system with a 
conversational experience.

Q: What benefits does PieKul provide?

A: We provide the following benefit to the stakeholders:
a) Students navigate and discover content by simply asking questions 
using natural interfaces, such as natural language in semantic space. 
When reviewing material, content is auto-summarized into snackable bits. 
Non-trivial assessment questions, such as definitional questions, are 
auto-paraphrased to ensure students are not rote learning. The system 
allows non trivial answers, such as paragraphs, are accepted and 
evaluations are instantly available. Students cover material via the 
help of an embedded recommendation engine, which is powered by a 
context model, which includes the performance of the student on 
prior assessments, her interest, and the topics specified by the 
Educator/Parent. The overall experience is heavily personified and 
contextualized.
b) Educators are relieved from the burden to support collaboration 
channels as prior asked or obvious questions posed on the channel 
are instantly answered by a QnA savant. The conversation interface 
allows the Educator to set personalized goals and exercises for 
students as well as easily extract visuals of multi-dimensional 
analytic queries.
c) Publishers convert legacy static content and/or non-QnA enabled 
digital content to a conversational engine enable content using 
our conversion pipeline. The automation of the process includes 
the semantic indexing required for content navigation, generation 
of summaries, generation of assessment questions, evaluation and 
acceptance of phrased answers, etc.
d) Parents use the intuitive and natural conversation interface 
to easily extract any insight about their studentâ€™s performance, 
progress, and attention to the learning material. The same 
interface allows Parents to communicate/collaborate with the 
Educator/student to support learning goals.

Q: How does PieKul's service work?

A: Recent NLU/MachineLearning/AI breakthroughs, many
as recent as 2015-2017- allows us to solve various 
facets of our problem at scale. 
As an example, for answering simple factoid QnA, we 
first apply Information Retrieval techniques to select 
a set of passages relevant to a question. Then we use 
attention like mechanism to compare a question with 
sequential token windows from each of the selected passages. 
Similarly to solve simple reasoning about entailment, 
we use RNN with Long Short Term Memory with attention 
to do fine grained reasoning across words, phrases and 
larger constructs across a pair of sentences.
