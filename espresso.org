* SD-WAN
** Notes
*** Correct IP address chosen: Internet/MPLS
*** Peer with Cloud on a loopback address.

** Use Case: 
*** DB/BW Scale at different points of presence
*** Federated Model: Multi-Hop BGP with Source Route
** Design Objectives
*** App-aware large scale routing
**** Override BGP specified forwarding behavior at fine granularity.
**** Legacy IP routing operates on low-level information 
    i.e. BGP announcements & policies.
**** Operating app-aware fine-grained policies require 
     complex BGP rules - hard to manage/reason/implement.

*** Incremental Brownfield Deployment: No forklift upgrade
*** Five 9 (99.999%) service availability i.e. <5 mins downtime/yr
*** New feature ease/velocity at Svc, Mgmt, CP,  and DP layers.
**** Feature dev to production in weeks rather than quarters.
** Design Consequence
*** Avoid new IETF (standardization efforts) or DP switch silicon.
*** Scale up means any upgrade/failure affects substantial % of traffic.
*** TCO per bit 4-10x relative to custom silicon.
*** Akin to B2 connecting DCs => peering edges => End Users. 


* Summary
** Application aware routing at Internet-peering scale.
** Host based routing/packet processing
** Fine-grained traffic engineering.

* Peering Edge
** Typically located at Metros
** Objectives
*** Peering with partner AS 
*** Server pool of reverse proxies for TCP termination
*** Caching and content distribution of static content

* Design Objectives
** Support interactive low latency to a global user population
** Line of defense against DoS and related attacks
** Reduce buildout of the backbone network back to DC

* Edge Routers
** Management & Configuration Complexity
*** Few boxes with highest scale BW, ports, and packet processing rates.
** Large DB: Internet-scale forwarding tables: 1M entries
** Large ACLs: complex and large scale firewall and anti-DOS rules
** High end compute for BGP to manage 100s of peering sessions

* Mechanisms
** Externalize most network control from devices leaving mostly
    MPLS DP and latency sensitive control loop functionality.
** PP, routing on Int scale forwarding tables and ACLs to sw PP 
    running on cluster server in edge Pops.
** Centrally enable gobal & app-aware TE system for 
   fine-grained BW mgmt with an e2e per flow performance i.e.
   much better than vanilla distributed BGP-based routing.
** Move BGP to a custom stack running on servers.
