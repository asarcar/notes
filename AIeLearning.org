* Summary
"AI Grand Challenges for Education: Woolf et al."
Static printed textbooks is an anochronistic remain of 19th century 
physical world where fixed classrooms and lectures prevailed - incapable 
of serving a mobile and digital society or adapting to the future.
+ Learning Science & Neuroscience Research:
  ++ Learn more when working in teams on motivating/challenging 
     group projects.
  ++ Retain more when immediately applied what learnt.
  ++ Learn more when help from tutors respond quickly
     with deep understanding of learner's background.
+ How are those knowledge of congnition applicable in digital environments?
  ++ Develop representations & reasoning about new cognitive insights.
  ++ Measure, enhance, and integrate collaborative activity.

+ Learning is fun when at topics exist at the periphery of learning knowledge:
  ++ Endorphins released giving us pleasure.
  ++ Dopamine released causing addiction.
  ++ Mismatch between teaching techniques and learning methods.
+ Ken Robinson: 
  ++ Education Transformed vs Reformed
  ++ Less Standardization and More Personalization
+ Levels of Learning
  ++ Level 1: Rote Learning - Factual "What is 5x7? Capital of France?"
    +++ Cramming: Retention goes down with time after exam.
    +++ Spaced Repetition: Refresh with longer progressive retention.
    +++ "Active Recall" better than "Passive Learning"
        i.e. flashcards/quizzes vs highlighting/re-reading
  ++ Level 2: Generative AI - Ability to generate personalized content & Qs
    +++ Generate Content (music) based on student's level 
    +++ What? - Personalized Content e.g. Music Synthesis
    +++ Why? - Link Content/World via group projects & Communication and 
        Collaboration e.g. social networking platforms
  ++ Level 3: Integrative AI - Match Generative AI and integrate with environment
     using technologies: 
     +++ VR for language learning based on scenarios to reinforce
     +++ xBox detects movement to teach dance, martial arts, sign language.
     +++ Simulation Envs with visualization - learn movement in magnetic fields.

+ Skill Requirement Change
  ++ Routine Knowledge Work e.g back office going to decrease
  ++ Non-routine creative knowledge work - design solutions to world problems
+ Future Education: Beyond knowledge transfer
  ++ Valued Skill is not knowledge (Google has plenty) but how it is applied 
    +++ Technology is not eliminating this skill
    +++ Embrace technology to extend the horizon of possible solutions
  ++ Knowledge disemmination from best instructors scaled via technology
  ++ Design Solutions in supervised but deeply collaborative framework
    +++ Problem Based Learning: Apply to real world problems to find
        drastic new solutions to existing new problems
    +++ Immersion: Real time decision taking over longer periods of time
    +++ Simulation: Iterative/Free to experiment, failure is cheap, process/style
        based evalution in addition to outcomes

+ Quotes
  ++ "Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of 
      the mind to think.": Albert Einstein
  ++ "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but woods that
      needs igniting.": Plutarch
+ Active Learning
  ++ Respond to questions that student's initiate. 
  ++ Listen to what student's are thinking.
+ Teaching Techniques
  ++ Collaboration & Communication: Social Media
  ++ Critical Thinking & Creativity (Problem Solving)
    +++ Choice based on interest
    +++ Student Centered with Teacher as a guide
+ Relationships
  ++ Teacher's passion i.e. love for subject is infectious
  ++ Teacher's care for student's interest is inspiring

+ Brain Changes to support learning
  ++ Releasing Chemicals - short term changes
  ++ Connections - long term changes
  ++ Function - areas more excited for specialized signals

** AI Grand Challenges for Education
+ Challenges: 
  ++ Mentors for every learner.
  ++ Learning 21st century skills.
  ++ Interaction data to support learning
  ++ Universal access to global classrooms
  ++ Lifelong and lifewide learning
+ Mentors for every learner:
  Students learn best in collaboration working on specific relatable 
  problems in small groups (J&J 1994).
  ++ Personalized: Computation AI-based tools reason about a student's 
  strengths, weaknesses, challenges, motivational style, cognition, 
  metacognition (thinking about learning), emotion, and motivation.
  ++ User Models: Mine/explore unique types of data to understand user.
  The model can also aid the tutor controller to assign a task of 
  appropriate of difficulty and skill requirement.
    +++ Knowledge/skills mastered by student and settings in which they 
    learn (re: Conati and Kardan [2013], Koedinger et al. [2013]). 
    +++ Communicative competencies and Collaborative achievements.
    +++ Misconceptions, (cultural) preferences/interests, learning goals, 
        plans, beliefs, and metacognitive/emotional/teamwork skills.
    +++ Track when/how skills learned and what pedagogies worked best.
  ++ "Modern Book": Paper textbooks will evolve into digital workbooks 
  that are aware of contexts - e.g. user models - and provide students 
  with immersive learning experiences, breaking away from current linear 
  flow, to be adaptive to studentâ€™s current state of learning, to embed 
  simulation and virtual laboratories, and to more broadly engage in
  dialogues with students.
  ++ eTutor: Learning by design (Kolodner 2002) advocates learning science 
  in the context of trying to solve a problem, where one may need a 
  solution approach specific science mentor illuminating concepts in 
  service of completing the design. 
  ++ Integration of Disciplines: Cognitive and emotional modeling, knowledge 
  representation, reasoning, natural language question answering, and 
  machine-learning methods (Woolf 2009).
+ Learning 21st century skills:
  Technology changes every few years rippling to problem & solution areas. 
  Acquire new knowledge quickly, explore alternative approaches, and connecting
  with new learning communities would be key skills. 
  ++ Cognitive Skills - nonroutine problem solving, systems/critical thinking
  ++ Interpersonal Skills - active listening, presentation, conflict resolution
  ++ Intrapersonal Skills - adaptability, self-management/development
* Companies
+ Language
  ++ Duolingo: Learning language via gamification - immersive 
     experience given points.
* Articles
** Gaming
+ Gaming helps Engagement & Learning
  ++ Interactive, Data Collection, Analytics,  and Real Time Simulations
  ++ Repetition with Optimal Cadence
  ++ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
  ++ Puzzles
  ++ Pattern Recognition
  ++ Manage time/resource
  ++ Leveling Up
  ++ Planning Workflows
  ++ Competing
  ++ Discovering/Exploring
  ++ Seeking optimality under rules/constraints
  ++ Observing - Learn from others perform
  ++ Collaborating/Leadership
  ++ Interacting/Analyzing Data, etc.
  ++ Problem solving: Small interest based cohorts
+ Content Development & Personalized
https://elearningindustry.com/artificial-intelligence-will-shape-elearning: 
  ++ Barrier for eLearning - Initial cost of content development. 
  ++ Chapman Alliance Survey: 1 hr of eLearning content 49-125 hrs vs 
     22-82 hrs for instructor-led training (ILT). 
  ++ Automate generation of eLearning content by repurposing 
     existing content.
  ++ Using machines to help classify, organize, and present (appropriately
     based on student) content would greatly reduce the cost of 
     content development. 
  ++ Identifying related concepts across subjects reduces resources 
     required to repurpose content and allows producing new content 
     in subjects not initially developed e.g. Optophysics deals with 
     concepts in Physics and Optometry.
