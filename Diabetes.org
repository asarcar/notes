* Statistics: https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics/2014statisticsreport.html 
+ Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
  ++ Diabetes
    +++ 29.1M or 1 out of 11 have diabetes
    +++ 21.0M diagnosed
    +++ 08.1M or 1 out of 4 are undiagnosed i.e. don't know they have diabetes
  ++ Prediabetes
    +++ >86M or more than 1 out of 3 have prediabetes 
    +++ 9 out of 10 don't know they have pre-diabetes
    +++ 15-30% will develop prediabetes within 5 years
  ++ Types
    +++ Type1: 5% of diabetic patients
    +++ Type2: 1 out of 3 people will develop Type 2 diabetes in lifetime
  ++ Dollars: $245B total medical costs & lost work/wages for people with diagnozed diabetes
  ++ Management/Avoidance: Lose Weight, Eat Healthy, and Be Active
  ++ Collateral Risks: Blindness, Kidney Failure, Heart Disease, Stroke, and Loss of Toes/Feet/Legs
* Diabetes Mellitus
Insulin is a hormone generated by Pancreas that helps sugar gets 
into cells. Insufficient insulin production or body response to insulin 
builds up sugar in blood.
+ Types of Diabetes
  ++ Type 1: Pancreas does not make enough insulin.
  ++ Type 2: Body becomes resistant to normal/high levels of insulin. 
  Pancreas is not able to keep up with the very high levels
  of insulin required to function and loses ability over time. 
  This causes high blood glucose (sugar) levels leading to problems.
** Type 2 Diabetes
Chronic medical condition requiring regular monitoring/treatment.
Treatments: Lifestyle changes, Self-care measures, and Medications.
** Resources
- Group Classes
- Meetings with a nutritionist
- Social Worker
- Nurse Educator
- Educational  Resources: Books, Web Sites, or Magazines
** Causes
- Genetic Predispositions: Type 2 Diabetes, high cholesterol level, 
high blood pressure, or obesity. 5-10x higher with first-degree relatives.
- Ethnic Groups: Hispanic, African, or Asian descent are predisposed.
- Environmental: What we eat, passive lifestyle, combine with genetic causes.
- Pregnancy: Gestational diabetes are more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes.
** Symptoms
- Urinate frequently
- Feeling thirsty
- Blurred Vision
** Laboratory Tests
- Random Blood Sugar RBS: Normal is less than 200 mg/dL.
- Fasting (8-12 hours of not eating/drinking) FBS: Normal is less than 100 mg/dL.
- Hemoglobin A1C: Test average blood sugar over 2-3 months. Normal 4-5.6%.
- Oral Glucose Tolerance Test OGTT: Test blood sugar before  and 1-2 hours 
  after drinking special glucose solution. 
** Diagnosis
Normal: Fasting blood sugar level is normal.
+ Increased Risk
  ++ Impaired fasting glucose IFG: 100-125mg/dL fasting glucose sugar level.
       Most common >50% develop type 2 diabetest. 
  ++ Impaired glucose tolerance IGT: 140-199mg/dL 2 hours after OGTT.
       11% of people 20-74 age have IGT.
  ++ A1C: 5.7-6.4% highest risk. Continuum at lower levels.
+ Confirmed Diagnosis: Blood tests reveal in two separate days the following.
  ++ Symptoms and RBS > 200mg/dL.
  ++ IFG > 126mg/dL
  ++ IGT > 200mg/dL
  ++ A1C > 6.5%
