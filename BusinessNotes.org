* Summary
We lack attention, engage mostly to games, and spend most of our time 
on mobile/messaging/voice platforms. Our comprehension/retention
of any topic in this uber information age is perfunctory. 

While elementary comprehension and basic retention of topics can be 
supported through simple QnA service, we've lacked a scalable and 
engaging solution due to the following reasons:
a) Dry: We would neither engage nor learn from a QnA service, unless 
it is delivered in a highly contextual, personalized, conversational, and 
trivia/gamified/fun way.
b) Manual: The flavor/structure of basic factoid questions and 
acceptable answers is rigid and scripted. The crafting process has been 
largely manual, which neither economicaly scales wrt amount of content, 
number of users, types of users, etc., nor is it timely wrt fresh/new content.

PieKul is building the data processing and learning pipeline required to 
deliver a scalable and engaging content review service.

Founders of PieKul: (a) Quaizar Vohra has a B.Tech from IIT Delhi and was 
a graduate student of Stanford in the area of Big Data, ML, and AI. 
(b) Arijit Sarcar has a B.Tech from C.S. IIT Delhi and a graduate of
UC Berkeley. Both were Distinguished Engineers of Juniper in their past.

** Machine Intelligence for ERP Systems
- PROBLEM
    - ACTIONABLE INSIGHT, INTUITIVE ATTENTION, & PREDICTION:
        - Objective: Automatically discover insight (formerly via queries and visualization from BI tools) with artificial intelligence, intuitive attention with automatically learned features, and prediction learnt from years of domain expertise with deep learning.
        - Intent: Customer intent to un/subscribe, upsellable, ... products. Employee's intent to leave org or attract peers. Transactions with the intention to finance terrorism, launder money, fraud, etc. "Intent Insight" requires understanding over the structure and behavior of sources.
        - Risk: Connect business & information systems across Suppliers, Product Providers, Channels, and Customers, etc. to enable enterprise regulatory, monitoring, and reporting requirements around KYC.
    - MACHINE DRIVEN IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM
        - React to "Intent/Risk" via an automated job (task sequence) to drive recourse/remediation.
        - Identify Risk: CRM System identifies an unhappy & valued client likely to abandon product by correlating ERP/CRM system, rating in AMZN for the product, her tweets, her email/chat/voice-recording/vmail/calendars, her call center/vmail records, her feature usage pattern, her enhancement and support ticket requests, payment history, and revelation from IT logs showing the introduction of competitor product.
        - Mitigation ERS: Notify product head to prioritize support/feature requests from that customer, schedule meeting with Sales Director of the region of that product/customer, collect pricing discounts and support values possible for the customer, gather intel on the competitor, prepare notes for the sales director, add all the notes to the meeting.
    - MODEL ENHANCEMENTS
- MARKET
    - BCC Research predicts the ML market will reach $15.3 billion by 2019, with an average annual growth rate of 19.7 percent.

    - Predictive analytics software, which is expected to reach $6.5 billion worldwide in 2019, up from $2 billion in 2012
- DATA PROBLEM IN ERP SYSTEM
    - Poor Characteristics:
        - Transactional low dimensional spartan Data fields in ERP system were governed by available technology, transactional relevance, and necessity to provide the ERP workflow and functionality.
        - Manual "System of Record" impacted quality - sales managers and account execs used ad-hoc myriad spreadsheets to track pipeline.
    - Siloed:
        - ERP systems grew organically, per vertical, and as isolated data lakes without any common data model for data normalization and cross pooling across ERP verticals and/or companies.
        - RDBMS poor in presenting longitudinal views (cross sectional across topics over time) for pattern recognition or insights leading to creation of large data warehouses which traded off time for insights.
    - Manual:
        - Encoding simple transactional behaviors through manual investigation into thousands of human-created & curated rules and event monitoring systems becomes obsolete, inaccurate, ... - impossibility of using humans to create and update rules on a RT basis - ML/AI rather than DB, forms & workflow expertise.
- INSIGHT & PREDICTION VIA LEARNING
    - Cross Data Learning Value: Characterizing any entity - customer (CRM) or employee (HR) - requires analysis beyond the nominal "bean counting" indexing and query/visualization techniques available to enterprises via either online/real-time (OLAP) or offline (Data Warehouse) systems.
    - Proof of Value: Web scale companies have demonstrated immense value by correlating seemingly unrelated signals - from Enterprise (ERP/CRM/...), IT (Transactional Logs/Click Through/...), Web, and OpenSource profiles, transactions, interactions, social posts, glass door, quora, etc. historical debris/signature of activity - by using learning techniques and behavioral analyses.
    - Newer Data Processing Solutions: The value was created by ingesting massive amount of disparate data sources over Non-Conventional Data Processing Systems (Hadoop, Spark, etc.) and then running custom domain specific learning algorithms for not just insight but prediction.

    - Finance: Anaplan, Adaptive Planning, and Trufa: ML/Analytics provide dynamic views into opportunities to drive more profit, grow faster, and generate efficiencies with changing business & market conditions as opposed to just recording every historical financial transaction.

- ENTERPRISE CHALLENGE: CUSTOMIZATION, SILOISM, AND DECAY
    - Custom: Even when enterprises adopted newer data processing pipelines, analysis in each domain required custom processing.
    - Data ingestion: Custom ETLs due to data siloism
    - Custom Domain Specific Algorithms:
        - Custom Galore: Supplementing of domain specific additional signals to supplement the low dimensional transactional spartan data, extensive feature tweaking/preparation, and custom learning algorithms.
        - Decay Over Time: In fact, even in web companies the custom algorithms required significant manpower to keep tweaking new data sources, features, and algorithms to ensure the insights stood the test of time as input characteristics changed over time (e.g. customer preference/taste/environment).
        - Domain Specific Silos: At its extreme the siloism permeated into separate orgs even in a specific domains (e.g. N different recommendation engines for users, content, ads, etc.)
    - Above challenges was way beyond the capabilities of Enterprise consumption.
- WHY AI/DEEP-LEARNING PIPELINE IS RELEVANT FOR ENTERPRISE
    - Deep Learning: Useful when we don't understand and don't have a model of how output is related to input.
    - Generic Approach: AI/DL allows one to use a common approach and algorithm across domains i.e. apply a common set of techniques across ERP verticals and (if allowed) even across organizations. Of course, one does need to tweak hyperparameters (e.g. neural pipeline depth/width and learning rate) but it is significantly less than custom algorithms.
    - No Decay: Just as a baby learns and improves continuously via observation, training, and adaptation so too does the predication.
- OVERCOMING DL REQUIREMENT CHALLENGES
    - High Dimensional & High Volume data:
        - Supplement low dimensional transactional ERP data with additional data
            - collected from Web, Enterprise, IT, OpenSource, etc. Note that Data Silo is still a challenge - the ability to even learn the custom ETL aspects via DL is still an area of research. Thus, ETL still has to be developed on a custom basis.
            - augmented via pattern generation.
        - Trained Models: Train domain specific data on models already trained on generic data or published trained models.
        - Transformed Models: Certain models are already available on a lower dimensional but semantically meaningful space. For example, word2vec transforms a much higher dimension word space to a lower dimension semantic space. It is easier now to interpret and analyze words in this reduced space.
        - Inverse Space Search: Modeling the negative use cases is often counter productive -  rather model positive use case and remove them from search space.
    - High Processing
        - Processed Features: Multiple DL models can be applied in stages, where each stage has already extracted the relevant features. It is easier to use this already processed features as input to a DL pipeline with lower processing burden.
        - GPU/TPU Platforms & Scale-Out algoritms.

      FPNA Forecast $\implies$ Sales Force (SF Quota) $\implies$ 
      Sales Operations Commissions (Claridus) $\implies$ 
      Payroll (ADP) $\implies$ Accounts Payable (Oracle) 
  -- Requests Queued behind IT Data Analysts writing SQL.
  -- Lacks EXCEL power: Drag/Drop, Pivots, What if scenarios, etc. 
- Solutions
  -- One System: "Hub" Model of Data Warehouse. 
     Mulitiple Models based on use case pull information 
     FPNA Budget/Forecast $\implies$ Sales Quota Allocation $\implies$
